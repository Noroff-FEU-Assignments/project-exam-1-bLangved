![Skjermbilde 2023-06-08 kl  16 06 35](https://github.com/Noroff-FEU-Assignments/project-exam-1-bLangved/assets/101604131/514d7bb5-08b7-4b75-aab7-32e3d1f04f24)


A project blog-website for all things guitar related. 

## Description

This project was a school exam where I was supposed to create a blog website with posts about a topic of my choice. The blog is about guitar-related topics.  

Most media assets are gotten from free image sites, or AI-generated photos. 
Logo, top image on main-page and a few more are created by me using https://www.canva.com/. 
All articles and excerpts are generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT (but titles by me). 


The website contains the following pages:

- Main page
- Contact page
- About page
- Blog specific page (when you click a random blog article)
- Categories page
- List of blog articles page

### Target audience was: 
People interested in about reading / learning about guitar related subjects

## Built With

This website was built using the following languages: 

- HTML 5
- CSS
- Javascript

Databases are created using Wordpress, and fetched with javascript using the REST API. 

## Getting Started

### Installing

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Noroff-FEU-Assignments/project-exam-1-bLangved.git
```

### Running

Contains a few static files (logo, favicon + a few others). 
You will need access to a Wordpress site, and retrieve data using the REST API. Change out BaseUrl-variables to your own wordpress URL in all js-files, and it should run.
It fetches data created as "posts" in wordpress. Top images are fetched as "featured image". Most content in articles should be formated pretty ok. 
Might need some additional CSS-styling based on content in Wordpress posts, if other types of post-blocks are used compared to mine.
